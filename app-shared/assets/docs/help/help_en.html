<h1>Orchid Help</h1>
<p>Welcome to Orchid. Please email contact@orchid.com for help needed, or for general feedback.</p>

<h1>The Orchid app</h1>
<p>Using Orchid is different from other VPN apps. Orchid connects you to a VPN marketplace with multiple VPNs offering service to you. Each time you connect, you are assigned a provider from the pool in accordance with the stake-weighted directory structure. If at anytime you dislike your service, you can turn Orchid off and then on again to recycle the connection and get reassigned to a provider.</p>

<p>To pay the VPN providers for service, the app needs access to an Orchid account. Learn how to setup an Orchid account using the OXT and ETH digital currencies below, or how to add an existing account that someone has shared with you. The <a href="https://www.orchid.com/join">Join page</a> on the website has the most up to date directions and a video walk-through.</p>

<h1>Setting up an Orchid account</h1>
<p>An Orchid account consists of OXT that has been moved into the Orchid nanopayment smart contract. Once the account is setup, anyone with access to the account can send nanopayments backed by the OXT in that account. Seting up the account costs ETH in 'gas', so creating an Orchid account requires both OXT and ETH digital currencies. </p>

<h2>Get OXT and ETH</h2>
<p>You need the OXT digital currency to pay providers for service. 10 OXT is enough to get started and should provide approximately 60 Gigabytes of VPN service. You will also need approximately .005 ETH to pay for the two transactions on Ethereum that are required to setup the Orchid account. Right now, <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/orchid">Coinbase</a> lists OXT and ETH. Free OXT is available through Coinbase's Earn campaign. Other places where OXT is available include Uniswap and other Ethereum exchanges.</p>
<p>Remember: You only pay for the service you use, so whenever you turn Orchid off you are no longer spending OXT from your Orchid account. </p>

<h2>Add the OXT and ETH to a web3-enabled Ethereum wallet</h2>
<p>Every Orchid account requires an Ethereum wallet from which to fund the account. We recommend setting up a new Ethereum wallet for using Orchid that is unassociated from other Ethereum services that you may use. We have tested and support a number of wallets, but some may work better than others depending on your setup. The easiest will be to setup your Orchid account using the Metamask browser plugin on a laptop or desktop.</p>

<p>Suggested wallets:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://metamask.io">Metamask</a> - Our recommendation is to use the Metamask Chrome plug-in from a laptop or desktop.</li>
  <li><a href="https://trustwallet.com">Trust Wallet</a> - Works on Android and iOS.</li>
  <li><a href="https://wallet.coinbase.com">Coinbase Wallet</a> - Works on Android and iOS. Might lose DApp functions soon on iOS.</li>
  <li><a href="https://brd.com/">BRD Wallet</a> - Works on Android and iOS.</li>
</ol>

<p>We recommend setting up a new wallet for use with Orchid for privacy. <a href="https://www.orchid.com/faq#orchid-app--why-new-wallet">Learn more. </a></p>

<p>Move your OXT and ETH to the new wallet you have setup. If you used Coinbase to earn or purchase your OXT and ETH, go into Coinbase and do a "send" from there to the Ethereum wallet's address. Moving both the OXT and ETH will cost a tiny amount of ETH in gas cost. You will need both in your wallet to create an Orchid account.</p>

<h2>Create and fund an Orchid account</h2>
<p>Your gateway to funding Orchid is found at <a href="https://account.orchid.com/">account.orchid.com</a>. The webpage is a web3-enabled front end that interfaces with the Orchid nanopayment contract. Account.orchid.com will need to be loaded with the Metamask plugin enabled or from your wallet's DApp browser. Once the page is loaded correctly, you can transfer funds between your wallet and Orchid. This is also where you can top-up your account balance or withdraw your funds after you have created an account and linked it to the app.</p>

<p>You will need a funded wallet with account.orchid.com loaded in order to create an Orchid account. Mobile wallets have a browser built into them, typically called a DApp browser. For the Metamask plugin, simply load the page with Metamask enabled and accept the connection request. It is a good idea to bookmark account.orchid.com so you can navigate back easily.</p>

<p>Read the text on the account.orchid.com page. The page is responsive and will tell you if you need to add more OXT or ETH to your wallet for account creation. Once ready, you can click or tap on the "Transfer Available OXT:" purple button which will initiate 2 transactions that you will need to approve.</p>

<p>Note- we recommend editing the transaction fee and paying extra ETH for "fast" so that the Orchid account is created within 30-60 seconds. Paying for slow sometimes can cause the transactions to hang. </p>

<p>Once your account is created, a QR code will appear on the page. If you don't see the QR code on the Overview page, it is available by clicking on the More link in the upper right of the page and selecting Info. From there you can see your account balance and the QR code.</p>


<h2>Adding your Orchid account to the app</h2>

<p>To add your newly created Orchid account, simply open the app and press the QR code icon on the initial help text pop. If that doesn't appear for you, select "New Hop" on the homescreen and then "I have a QR code" from the add hop screen. Scan or copy/paste the code into the app.</p>

<p>Once you scan the QR code, the app will create a hop using that Orchid account and your default curator settings. You will then be dropped into the hop information screen that shows the saved information. Using the "Share Orchid Account" button, you can pop a QR code and share the Orchid account you just created with other people or devices. Press the back arrow to get back to the main screen. </p>

<p>From the main screen, turn the toggle in the upper right to turn Orchid on.</p>
