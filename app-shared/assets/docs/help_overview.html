<h1>Welcome to Orchid</h1>
<p>Orchid is a new type of VPN that gives you insight into how you are using data and control over
  where it is going. This first release of Orchid focuses on analysis and shows you when and where
  your apps are connecting to the Internet.</p>

<p>The Orchid app is a kind of “packet sniffer” for your phone. The application runs as a VPN
  service, allowing it to inspect packets entering and leaving your device and logging the traffic
  for your review. In order to do this Orchid needs the VPN permission on your phone.</p>

<h2>How to Use the App</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Simply turn on Orchid with the switch in the upper right of the app bar.</li>
  <li>The first time you turn on the switch you will be prompted to grant VPN permissions to the app.
    You can turn Orchid off and at any time using the switch.  To clear recorded data see
    “How to delete your data” below.</li>
  <li>After a few seconds you should start to see some network traffic.  However keep in mind that
    most network activity occurs while you are using other apps.  So you may want to switch back
    to your normal activity for a while and then return to see what has been logged.
    For example, try switching to your web browser and visiting a site.
    When you return to Orchid you should see that web traffic has been logged.
    Note that it may be easier to find what you are looking for using the search features (see
    below).</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use the Search / Filter Bar</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Enter a hostname or partial hostname into the search bar to show only matching rows.</li>
  <li>Enter multiple terms separated by a space to combine hostname filters using “AND” logic.
    e.g. “goog api” will match rows including both “goog” and “api”, such as “api1.google.com”.</li>
  <li>Use a “-” minus sign to exclude terms.  e.g. “-goog” will show all hostnames *except*
    those matching “goog”. You can mix these to include and exclude combinations such as:
    “google -api” to find all “google” entries excluding those with “api”.</li>
  <li>Use “proc: &lt;name of protocol&gt;” to filter by protocol name. e.g. “prot:imap” will match all
    traffic identified as “imap” connections and “-prot:dns” will filter out all DNS queries from
    the results.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Delete Your Data</h2>
Orchid stores the data it analyzes privately on your device. If you wish to clear your data history open the side drawer using the
hamburger menu (or by edge swiping), select “Clear Data”,
and confirm the delete. Deleting the app from your device also removes the data of course.

<h2>Parts of the Network Traffic Displayed</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Source IP Address, Destination IP Address</li>
  <li>Source Port, Destination Port</li>
  <li>Hostname (when available)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Open Source</h2>
Orchid is a 100% open source project, so you can have confidence that the app is on your side and
not sharing your data with anyone but you. You can get Orchid from a trusted source such as the
official app store for your device or, if you are a developer, build and install it yourself!
