Overview
========
The Orchid app is an Open Source packet analyzer that allows you to view your
network traffic locally on your device, without connecting through a server.
The packet capture runs on the phone only, providing you with a stream of
information including IP addresses, hostnames and ports for insight and
analysis of your  internet traffic.

Features
========
* Local VPN service for packet capture
* Advanced filtering to drill down on the data you care about
* Source and destination IP address & port number
* Open Source

Vision
======
Our vision is to enable secure access to the internet for everyone, everywhere.
Over the coming months, weâ€™ll be releasing more features in our suite of
privacy-enabling tools. We are working towards a decentralized marketplace for
VPN service.
